Some of tricky programming problems and solutions.

## Array Problems

### Problem1

- Given an unsorted array of integers, find **a pair** with given sum in it.
  - Input: [8,7,2,5,3,1]
  - Sum: 10
  - OutPut:
    - (8, 2)
    - (7, 3)

### Problem2

- Given an unsorted array of integers, print **all sub-arrays** with sum 0.
- This problem can also be written as find all sub-arrays whose sum is given sum like 10.
- Remember that, in this case sub-array has to be consicutive. Re-arrannging elements are not allowed.
  - Input: [4,2,-3,-1,0,4]
  - Sum: 0
  - OutPut:
    - [-3,-1,0,4]
    - [0]

### Problem3

- Given an unsorted binary array, Sort it in linear time and constant space.
  - Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1]
  - OutPut: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]

### Problem4

- Given an unsorted array, find total occurence count.

  - Input: [1,2,4,7,2,3,6,3,4,5,7,3,3,4,5]
  - OutPut: {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 7: 2,6: 1, 5: 2}
